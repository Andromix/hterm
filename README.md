# hterm

hterm is a JS library that provides a terminal emulator.  It is reasonably fast,
reasonably correct, and reasonably portable across browsers.

Do not confuse this with an ssh client (like [Secure Shell](../nassh/)) or a
shell environment by itself.  It only provides the platform for rendering
terminal output and accepting keyboard input.
